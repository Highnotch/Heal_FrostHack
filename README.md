# HEAL - Health Evaluation and Lab Analysis

We have created a disease diagnosis website that uses machine learning models to assist doctors and 
medical practitioners in diagnosis of certain diseases and health issues.

The website is used in these 
diagnosis:
1. Brain tumor detection from MRI scans
2. Pneumonia detection from Chest X-Rays
3. Stroke risk prediction
4. Early stage diabetes prediction
5. Chronic kidney disease diagnosis
6. Liver diagnosis
7. Heart diagnosis

As our project contain large files we have used git LFS , if you wish to pull the repository on another device, simply install git-lfs on that device(per local repository).

To use this website on your localhost, clone this repository and run the app.py file.
